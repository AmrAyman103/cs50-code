####  Description:

 and modify it according to the level of physical fitness and the level of body weight.
Accordingly, the program that is allocated to the individual applying to enter

the gym is determined to know the extent of his physical fitness and his ability

to perform exercises and the appropriate training program that is compatible with his fitness.

His physique and weight provide him with the best possible

athletic performance with the best results When the program

is run, the weight standard is transferred to the program

that allows the new participant to reach the best possible

results. After that, the number of push-ups is converted

to the fitness level enjoyed by the new participant

to determine a program that suits him and has an

effective return on the level of fitness.

Physical fitness and physical health in

general, and this is what the program

can implement to help gym owners save time.

The program automatically converts data

related to weight and the number of

times pressing the ground or

 doing push-ups, which reflects

the extent of fitness of the applicant or

 new participant of the program

 and provides a sports program that suits him.

Run the script from the command line with the required arguments.

The script seems to process data related to programs and individuals,

modifying the format and content in the output CSV file based on specific conditions.
## Features
We can automatically transfer, by knowing the weight,
